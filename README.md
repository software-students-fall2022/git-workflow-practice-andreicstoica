[Agile and the Long Crisis of Software by Miriam Posner](https://logicmag.io/clouds/agile-and-the-long-crisis-of-software/)

I personally didn't know much about the start of 'agile' - which is a framework I've worked within for some time now. I thought the way corporations co-opted Agile to wrangle in software engineering's messy timelines was interesting, as was the ontology of 'software engineering' as a term.

Andrei had sent me this article before and I found it quite interesting. I did not know the original history of Agile and I emjoyed reading about how it was developed. I think the article also does a good job of pointing out the flaws in Agile. - Grace Zhang
